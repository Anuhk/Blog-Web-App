# Blog-Web-App

A full-stack Blog Application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. This project allowed me to understand the fundamentals of backend development, client-server architecture, and how dynamic web applications work behind the scenes.

🌐 Project Overview

This blog app enables users to:

* Create new blog posts

* View a feed of all existing posts on the homepage

* Edit existing posts

* Delete posts as needed

🧠 What I Learned
Working on this project helped me gain a deeper understanding of:

* Backend Development using Node.js and Express.js

*  Client-Server Architecture and request-response flow

*  Handling HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

* Implementing RESTful routing

*  Using EJS for dynamic HTML templating

*  Structuring a full-stack application using the MVC pattern

🛠️ Technologies Used
* Node.js – JavaScript runtime for building the server

* Express.js – Web framework for handling routing and middleware

* EJS (Embedded JavaScript) – Templating engine for rendering dynamic views

* Body-Parser – Middleware for parsing request bodies

* Nodemon – Auto-restarting development server

📌 Core Features
*  Post Creation – Users can compose and publish new posts

*  Feed View – Home page displays all published posts

* Edit Posts – Posts can be updated dynamically

*  Delete Posts – Users can remove unwanted posts

* Templating with EJS – Dynamic rendering of pages with server-side data

🚀 How It Works

* The user interacts with the frontend (EJS templates).

* Routes defined in Express.js handle the user's requests.

* The backend processes data and sends the appropriate response.

* EJS templates dynamically render pages based on backend data.
